                    <h3>Hypertension</h3>
                    <p>Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition in which the force of blood against the artery walls remains consistently high. Over time, this increased pressure can cause serious health problems such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage.

Often called the “silent killer”, hypertension may not show obvious symptoms until significant damage has occurred. That’s why early detection and monitoring are vital.</p>
